## Instructions
# I used these SDK's for start :
- For wallet which provided at the index.tsx and walletprovider integrated on app.tsx SUIET KIT  Docs=> https://kit.suiet.app/docs/QuickStart
- Move files backend part also settled. You can reach its docs for Smart Contract development => https://docs.sui.io/learn
- Actually SUI have own Typescript SDK but I want to use @scallops SDK to integrate it to frontend but I'm gonna provide 2 of them scallops => https://github.com/scallop-io/sui-kit SUI's => https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/sdk/typescript
- For creating dex I used OMNISWAP SDK u can reach on there => https://github.com/OmniBTC/OmniSwap-Sui-SDK
- Also if you want to deploy your MOVE Contract on testnet u should reach there for docs => https://docs.sui.io/build/install

# All integrated

- You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

- [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

- The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

- This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
